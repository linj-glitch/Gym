"""Constraint grading core — single source of truth for the DETAILED constraint family.

Family note (2026-09-08): this package is the runtime of the *detailed* family (hand-written registry,
one verifier per constraint id). It is a benchmark family; RL training data now comes from the *template*
family implemented in ``responses_api_agents/swe_if_agents/if_constraints/``. The agentic-if repo adapts
both to one interface (``instruction_pool/constraint_families/``).

Constraint semantics (registries + injectable instruction text), deterministic
verifiers, trajectory grading, and the shaped reward formula::

    reward = task_reward * (1 + alpha * constraint_reward)

This package is self-contained (stdlib + pydantic only) so it can be imported
without the rest of nemo_gym. The agentic-if repo — where constraint
*development* happens (curation ledger, keep-list audits, generation and
calibration pipelines, dataset builders) — re-exports these modules via shims
rather than duplicating them; this package must never import from agentic-if.

Public grading surface:

  parse_trajectory   Responses-API output items -> typed trajectory steps
  grade_constraints  steps + [{type, params}] -> GradingResult (scope filtering,
                     injection awareness, N/A handling, partial credit)
  compute_reward     shaped multiplicative reward (see formula above)
  InjectionMode      where the constraint text was placed in the prompt
