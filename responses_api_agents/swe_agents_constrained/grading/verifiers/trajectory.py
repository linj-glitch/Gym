"""Trajectory parsing and constraint grading — framework-free core.

This is the testable heart of constraint grading: it depends only on the
constraint registries and verifier implementations (all inside this grading
package), never on the rest of nemo_gym, so the grading semantics (scope
filtering, injection-turn awareness, N/A handling, reward aggregation) can be
unit-tested in any venv and the agent wrapper stays a thin shell around it.

Accepts either attribute-style items (pydantic Responses objects) or plain
dicts with the same keys.
